  Description: Old Crank has lived in Lot #3 longer than anyone remembers. The trailer
    is a rusted-out heap wrapped in layers of barbed wire, duct tape, and no less
    than 47 "KEEP OUT" signs. According to local legend, Crank was once a brilliant
    chemist who got kicked out of MIT for "askin' the real questions."
