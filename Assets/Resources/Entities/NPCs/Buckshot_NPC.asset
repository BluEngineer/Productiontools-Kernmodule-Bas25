  Description: " has been living in Gump Town since before there was a Gump Town,
    or at least that\u2019s what he claims (and loudly).\r\n Nobody knows how long
    he\u2019s actually been there because no one\u2019s ever seen him do anything
    except stumble in a half-circle, puke into a bush, and scream slurred political
    slogans at the moon."
